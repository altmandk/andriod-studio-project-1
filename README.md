My first Android app

A simple application that explores the use of different activites. 
The user will press a button to be transfered to another activity 
where they will be prompted to enter a name. The app will then 
return to the original activity and check if the name is valid.
If valid you can press a button to add the name to your contacts.
If not valid a toast message will appear when trying to add the
contact.
